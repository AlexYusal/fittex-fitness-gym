        <p>Alex Yusal is a fitness enthusiast and trainer.He started working out since he was a teenager (14 years) and officially became a trainer 6 years later. His ENTHUSIASM is on another level because the level at which he dedicates his time and effort is incredible. He is of high level of discipline and hardwork. His die-heartedness is one of the key factors that has given him an edge over others. And with the sufficient amount of  knowledge and wealth of experience embedded in him, he is more than happy to train and guide people to achieve their total fitness goals. 
                YOUR HEALTH IS YOUR GREATEST ASSET, so do not lose it.  </p>
